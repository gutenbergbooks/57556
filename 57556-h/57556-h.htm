<h2 class="nobreak">DOCTOR RABBIT GETS A CALL</h2></div>


<p>Doctor Rabbit lived in the very biggest
tree in the Big Green Woods. He looked
after all the other rabbits when they
were ill and he doctored quite a number
of the other little creatures of the Big
Woods too, when they did not feel well.
He was so jolly and cheerful, always
trying so hard to help others, that he
had a great many friends.</p>

<p>Doctor Rabbit said when he came to
live in the Big Green Woods he didn&#8217;t
have the least idea that he would have so
many adventures. &#8220;But then,&#8221; he said
one day as he curled his mustache, &#8220;it&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
a good thing I have so many adventures.
They make me take plenty of exercise,
and that&#8217;s fine for my constitution.&#8221;
What he meant by this was that exercise
kept him in good health.</p>

<p>I said Doctor Rabbit looked after some
of the other creatures when they were ill.
But there were some he did not dare go
near. Well, I should say not! For instance,
there was Ki-yi Coyote, who lived
out on the Wide Prairie just outside the
Big Green Woods. No, Doctor Rabbit
never went near Ki-yi Coyote. And if
old Ki-yi had been ill and if all his relatives
had been so ill they never again
would be able to get out of bed, Doctor
Rabbit would not have cared at all.
No indeed, he would have been glad of
it, because Ki-yi Coyote and all his relatives,
who lived far away, were ready
any time to gobble up Doctor Rabbit.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>Now, one fine morning in spring Doctor
Rabbit began to have trouble with Ki-yi.
On this morning Doctor Rabbit arose
from his bed very early and prepared a
fine breakfast for himself. He cooked
some nice new potatoes and green peas
he had found in Farmer Roe&#8217;s garden.
After he had eaten his breakfast he had
to wash the dishes because there wasn&#8217;t
anybody else to do it. You see, he lived
all alone in the big tree. He didn&#8217;t
like to wash dishes but he did it anyway.
Then he put on his second best pair of
glasses and went out in his front yard to
get some fresh air and see if his neighbor,
Blue Jay, was up.</p>

<p>There was a very good reason why he
wanted to know whether Blue Jay was
up. Just now Doctor Rabbit was greatly
troubled. Now, what do you suppose
he was troubled about? Why, word had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
been brought the night before that Billy
Rabbit, the small son of Jack and Mrs.
Jack Rabbit, who lived far out on the
Wide Prairie, was ill. Blue Jay had
come flying in to tell the news. He said
Mrs. Jack Rabbit told him if Billy was
not better by morning Doctor Rabbit
would simply have to cross the Wide
Prairie even if it <i>was</i> dangerous.</p>

<p>Now Doctor Rabbit was a cottontail
rabbit, so of course he couldn&#8217;t run faster
than any other cottontail. He could not
run anything like so fast nor so far as
could Jack Rabbit. So Doctor Rabbit
was greatly troubled this morning. He
could not sit still, but kept walking
slowly round and round in his front
yard. As he walked round and round he
said to himself, &#8220;I&#8217;ve never been so far
out on the open Wide Prairie as Jack
Rabbit&#8217;s. Suppose I should go away out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
there to see little sick Billy and Ki-yi
Coyote should get after me! Goodness
gracious! He would be almost sure to
catch me.&#8221; Doctor Rabbit trembled a
little and looked all around even though
he was right in his own dooryard. He
very much hoped he would not be called
to go so far out on the Wide Prairie.</p>

<p>But what he feared happened. Very
soon Jack Rabbit came running fast, and
flying right along with him came Blue
Jay. Busy Blue Jay generally knows
everything that is happening.</p>

<p>Jack Rabbit walked straight up to
Doctor Rabbit and, bowing politely, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so glad I found you at home,
Doctor. My son Billy is no better. In
fact, he is much worse, and we are
troubled about him. Can&#8217;t you run over
and see him right now?&#8221;</p>

<p>For a moment Doctor Rabbit did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
know what to say. He feared Ki-yi
Coyote, but at the same time he hated
to think of Billy Rabbit&#8217;s being so ill
with no one there to make him well.
He thought and thought. Finally he
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, Friend Jack Rabbit, I shall
try to get over to see your son. But as
you know, it&#8217;s very dangerous for me
because I can&#8217;t run more than half as fast
as <i>you</i> can. Now what could we do if
old Ki-yi Coyote should happen to get
after us?&#8221;</p>

<p>Friend Jack Rabbit scratched his head
and said he hadn&#8217;t thought about that.
It was a very serious matter, too. For
suppose Ki-yi Coyote should gobble up
good Doctor Rabbit! Then what would
the woods creatures do? They must
certainly plan some means of going in
safety.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>&#8220;Say!&#8221; said Doctor Rabbit suddenly,
&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought of a plan. I&#8217;ll just ride
on your back and we&#8217;ll get there in no
time!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Friend Jack Rabbit scratched his
head again. He wasn&#8217;t sure he could
carry Doctor Rabbit, because the Doctor
was very portly&mdash;that is, he was pretty
fat and heavy. But anyway he agreed
to try the plan. So Doctor Rabbit hurried
into his house and put on his best
pair of gold glasses and his best clothes.
He always liked, he said, to look his best
before his patients. Then with his medicine
case in hand he sprang upon Jack
Rabbit&#8217;s back.</p>

<p>&#8220;See how fast you can run to the edge
of the Big Green Woods. That will be
a good test!&#8221; shouted Doctor Rabbit,
and Jack Rabbit answered, &#8220;Very well.
If you&#8217;re ready I&#8217;ll try!&#8221;</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">IN FEAR OF KI-YI COYOTE</h2></div>


<p>Just as Jack Rabbit started for the
edge of the Big Green Woods with Doctor
Rabbit on his back, Blue Jay flew along
ahead of them. Then came Robin-the-Red,
whistling Red Bird and others.
They had never seen Doctor Rabbit ride
before and they all laughed and shouted
at the funny appearance he made.</p>

<p>Away went Jack Rabbit as fast as he
could for the edge of the Woods.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is fine!&#8221; cried Doctor Rabbit.
&#8220;Keep it up, Jack Rabbit, and we&#8217;ll be
at your house in a jiffy!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha! ha! ha!&#8221; laughed Blue Jay and
the others as they flew along near the
ground watching them. &#8220;Look at Doctor
Rabbit in his new automobile! Look
at him!&#8221; they shouted. Then they all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
laughed again. As they raced along
Stubby Woodchuck came out of his house
to see the funny sight, and so did Cheepy
Chipmunk and Chatty Red Squirrel and
Frisky Gray Squirrel and many others.</p>

<p>They all wondered if Jack Rabbit
could hold out carrying Doctor Rabbit so
far. They thought he must be mighty
strong if he could. But when he reached
the edge of the woods he stopped and
said he would have to give it up. He
lay down and panted for a while. By
and by he said he hadn&#8217;t the least idea
that Doctor Rabbit was so heavy. Indeed,
he said it seemed as if he was carrying
a house on his back by the time he
reached the edge of the woods.</p>

<p>Then they talked the matter over and
decided they would both walk&mdash;or run
if they had to. Doctor Rabbit was a
good deal worried. He looked out across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
the Wide Prairie and saw how far it was
to Jack Rabbit&#8217;s little house. How he
did hate to start! Then he had an idea.
He saw several small trees out on the
Prairie some distance apart. &#8220;Say! Jack
Rabbit,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I wonder if there are
any holes among the roots of those trees
so I could &#8216;hole up&#8217; [he meant run into
a hole] if I had to. I mean if Ki-yi
Coyote should get after us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure enough!&#8221; cried Jack Rabbit.
&#8220;The rain has washed bare the top roots
of every one of those trees and there are
two or three holes under every tree!&#8221;</p>

<p>Doctor Rabbit looked very straight
at Jack Rabbit and said, &#8220;Now are
you right sure about that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I am sure,&#8221; Jack Rabbit said;
&#8220;as sure as anything. It happens that
I was at every one of those trees just
yesterday and I sniffed and snuffed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
round every one of those holes. I didn&#8217;t
go into any of them for I don&#8217;t like to go
into holes. But those holes are certainly
there. And if Ki-yi Coyote should get
after us when we get pretty well out on
the Prairie, you could make for a tree
and I&#8217;d let him chase me. I&#8217;m not
much afraid of him because I&#8217;ve run
away from him many a time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; agreed Doctor Rabbit.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll go straight for the first tree.
When we get there we&#8217;ll look all around
for the least sign of slinky Ki-yi, and if
we don&#8217;t see anything we&#8217;ll move on to
the next tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure thing,&#8221; Jack Rabbit said; &#8220;that
will make you as safe as anything.&#8221; So
they started out. As they hurried along
Jack Rabbit said:</p>

<p>&#8220;When we leave the last tree we&#8217;ll
have only a little way to go to my home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
It&#8217;s just a little farther on beside an oak
fence post.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they kept going, hoppity, hoppity,
hop. And as they went Doctor Rabbit&#8217;s
courage rose little by little. After all,
thought he, perhaps Ki-yi Coyote would
not see them.</p>

<p>Even so, he kept a sharp eye out for
anything that might be moving in the
grass. And he told Jack Rabbit to do
the same.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed I will, sir,&#8221; Jack Rabbit
answered. &#8220;I always do look out. I
should say I do! And if Ki-yi Coyote
starts up I&#8217;ll see him quick as a flash!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then they hurried a bit faster because
Doctor Rabbit said he wanted to get to
the first tree and examine the holes for
himself.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE HOLES UNDER THE TREES</h2></div>


<p>Doctor Rabbit and Mr. Jack Rabbit
moved across the Wide Prairie and
looked about them in every direction.
There was a great deal of bunch grass
on the Wide Prairie, and this made them
very nervous. They knew how easy it
would be for Ki-yi Coyote to hide behind
one of those bunches of grass until an
innocent rabbit came very near.</p>

<p>Doctor Rabbit stopped and said, &#8220;I
really believe we should keep just as far
as possible from every bunch of grass.&#8221;
Then he jumped backward, because he
saw something moving in the grass.
But it proved to be nothing but a sunflower;
so they walked on.</p>

<p>By and by they came to the first tree,
and how glad they were! Doctor Rabbit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
went into the hole there to look about.
After a little time he came out and said
a gray squirrel had been there, but it
had been a good while before. He said
it looked to him like an old house that
people had lived in once, but not for a
long time. You know how the grass
grows up tall in the front yard, and the
windows get broken, and the doors creak
when you open them, and there is a
damp, musty smell in a house. Well,
Doctor Rabbit said it was that way in
the hole under the tree. Some animal,
a gray squirrel, maybe, had lived there,
and perhaps some other small animal
before the gray squirrel; but they were
gone now.</p>

<p>Doctor Rabbit said there was one thing
that bothered him a little.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; Friend Jack Rabbit
wanted to know. &#8220;Why,&#8221; replied wise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
Doctor Rabbit, &#8220;I was just thinking that
possibly Ki-yi Coyote knows who lived
here, and why they are gone. Maybe he
made a breakfast of them!&#8221;</p>

<p>They didn&#8217;t say any more about that
part of it, and pretty soon they came to
the next tree. Doctor Rabbit went into
the hole here, also. He was gone so
long that Jack Rabbit began to be quite
troubled; but finally Doctor Rabbit came
out and said a cottontail rabbit had been
in there, but it had been a good while
ago. He thought it likely that old
Ki-yi Coyote had gobbled up the cottontail
who had lived there.</p>

<p>&#8220;However,&#8221; Doctor Rabbit said, &#8220;possibly
he got away.&#8221; Then he exclaimed,
&#8220;I surely <i>hope</i> he got away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Doctor Rabbit looked into the holes
under the other two trees, and said some
small animals had once lived in them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>All this naturally made Doctor Rabbit
more and more nervous. It looked as
if no animal was safe out so far on the
Wide Prairie but fleet Jack Rabbit, and
even he had to watch out mighty close.</p>

<p>When they left the last tree, Doctor
Rabbit said, &#8220;Now let&#8217;s run good and
fast the rest of the way!&#8221;</p>

<p>And they did&mdash;hoppity, hoppity, hoppity,
so fast that they looked like two
long gray streaks going toward Jack
Rabbit&#8217;s home.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">DOCTORING BILLY RABBIT</h2></div>


<p>When Doctor Rabbit at last reached
Jack Rabbit&#8217;s home, he found Billy Rabbit
was suffering with nothing more than
a case of acute indigestion&mdash;that is, colic.
Doctor Rabbit said this was caused by
Billy&#8217;s having eaten too many green
peas from Farmer Roe&#8217;s garden.</p>

<p>Mrs. Jack Rabbit explained that kind
friends and neighbors had brought in all
sorts of patent medicines. These medicines,
they said, had cured many of their
family, even some who had lived before
they were born.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said Mrs. Jack Rabbit, looking
seriously at Doctor Rabbit, &#8220;although I
gave Billy all the medicine they brought,
he is no better. In fact, he is worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Doctor Rabbit looked at Billy Rabbit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
and then looked over his gold glasses at
the neighbors and friends standing all
around. Then he said, &#8220;He grew worse,
did he? Ahem! ahem! he grew worse!
I see! I see! Well, to tell you the
truth, Mrs. Jack Rabbit, after all that
dope I should think he <i>would</i> grow
worse!&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, that was pretty plain. Some of
the neighbors wanted to let it be known
that they were angry, but they didn&#8217;t
dare. No, you see their own work on
Billy Rabbit was a failure. They had
sent for the doctor, and they had to do
just what he said.</p>

<p>So they all kept still, and Doctor
Rabbit, after he had cleared his throat
in a very dignified way, said, &#8220;Mrs. Jack
Rabbit, I would thank you for a tablespoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>When he got the tablespoon, Doctor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
Rabbit gave Billy Rabbit about the
nastiest tasting medicine in the world.
Now, guess what it was! <i>Castor Oil?</i>
That&#8217;s right, you guessed it the first
time! Yes, that&#8217;s exactly what Doctor
Rabbit gave him&mdash;a whole tablespoonful.</p>

<p>Billy Rabbit swallowed the whole
spoonful before he knew what it was.
Then, although he had before been lying
quite still, he jumped around in the bed,
kicked off the covers, and said he never
would take another dose of medicine in
his life.</p>

<p>But Doctor Rabbit just laughed and
said that was the way little sick rabbits
usually talked. Then Doctor Rabbit
ordered some grass tea for his patient,
and no more green peas for a whole week.
&#8220;I shall have to be going now,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;and how I do wish I were back in the
Big Green Woods!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>Now all the jack rabbit neighbors were
feeling pretty friendly by this time, because
they saw that Doctor Rabbit
really was a very smart doctor. They
all wanted to go along with him for his
protection.</p>

<p>But Doctor Rabbit said, &#8220;No, that
will do no good. Ki-yi Coyote would
see <i>all</i> of us sooner than two of us.
Friend Jack Rabbit and I will go back
alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the two of them started back toward
the woods.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">KI-YI COYOTE CHASES
DOCTOR RABBIT</h2></div>


<p>Doctor Rabbit and Jack Rabbit hurried
along across the Wide Prairie until
they came to the first tree. Here Doctor
Rabbit said they had better stop and
look around a bit. So cautious Jack
Rabbit went up on a little hill and looked
all around, but he said he couldn&#8217;t see
a thing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you look mighty close in the
direction of the Big Green Woods?&#8221;
Doctor Rabbit wanted to know. (You
see this was the direction in which they
were going.)</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, I did look!&#8221; replied Jack
Rabbit. &#8220;I looked more closely in that
direction than in any other, and there
wasn&#8217;t a thing in sight.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Doctor Rabbit, &#8220;we&#8217;ll
go for the next tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>They came safely to the next tree, and
pretty soon they came to the last tree.
Doctor Rabbit was feeling fine now.
They stopped by the tree and talked for
a little while.</p>

<p>Doctor Rabbit said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I
should care much if Ki-yi Coyote did
come after us. I could run away from
him and be in the Big Green Woods in
no time!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Jack Rabbit had run away from
Ki-yi Coyote a good many times, and he
<i>knew</i>. So he said pretty seriously, &#8220;I
don&#8217;t know about that, Doctor Rabbit.
Ki-yi can run something awful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said Doctor Rabbit, &#8220;but
the Big Green Woods look so close that
I feel sure I could beat him that far.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then what do you suppose he said?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Well, he didn&#8217;t realize what he was saying,
of course, but this is what he said:
&#8220;Ha, ha, ha! Why, Friend Jack Rabbit,
I feel so sure about it that I wish old
Ki-yi <i>would</i> come tearing out this way
right now! Yes, sir! I wish he would.
Just let him come whenever he wants to.
If he came, I&#8217;d run away and be in the
Big Green Woods so quick he could
hardly see me.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then something happened, something
that Doctor Rabbit was not ready
for at all, because he really was not
expecting it. Just then Ki-yi Coyote <i>did</i>
come tearing over the great Wide Prairie
after them. And he came from the direction
of the <i>Big Green Woods</i>! Doctor
Rabbit had forgotten all about that.
He certainly was very much surprised,
and very badly scared. He could have
darted into the hole under the tree, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
course, and that is just what he should
have done. But sometimes when rabbits,
like little boys and girls, get scared,
they forget all about what is the best
thing to do. What Doctor Rabbit ought
to have done the very first thing when
he saw Ki-yi coming was to say to himself,
&#8220;Now, I mustn&#8217;t be so scared that I
don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m doing. I must be
careful and get out of this, because I
have no one to help me.&#8221;</p>

<p>But he didn&#8217;t stop to think. No, he
was so frightened he just hiked out
across the Wide Prairie!</p>

<p>Then kind Jack Rabbit was certainly
scared, not for himself, but for Doctor
Rabbit. So he started out after Doctor
Rabbit, and when he caught up he
shouted in his ear as loud as he could,
&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you, Doctor
Rabbit? You must be crazy! Now, I&#8217;ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
take care of Ki-yi Coyote and you dodge
back for that hole under the tree.&#8221; Then
Doctor Rabbit remembered. Crafty
Ki-yi was right close and tried hard to
seize him, but he didn&#8217;t, and Doctor
Rabbit darted safely into the hole.</p>

<p>It was a mighty close call. Ki-yi
Coyote&#8217;s sharp teeth had snapped twice
at Doctor Rabbit, once so close that some
of his tiny round tail was bitten off.</p>

<p>All this time clever Jack Rabbit was
close beside Doctor Rabbit, shouting
(just to fool Ki-yi Coyote, of course),
&#8220;Oh, my! I&#8217;ve got a broken leg! I&#8217;ve
got a broken leg! What shall I do if
Ki-yi Coyote comes after me! Oh, good
Ki-yi, please don&#8217;t come after me, &#8217;cause
I&#8217;ve got a broken leg!&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, if it hadn&#8217;t been for this, I think
that Ki-yi would certainly have caught
Doctor Rabbit, but after he had missed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
him once, and was just going for him
again, he heard Jack Rabbit&#8217;s moan. So
he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll go after Jack Rabbit. He
has a broken leg, and I can catch him
without half trying.&#8221; And off he started
after Jack Rabbit.</p>

<hr class="chap" />






<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">DOCTOR RABBIT GETS A SCARE</h2></div>


<p>When Jack Rabbit saw that Ki-yi
Coyote was after him, he started away
on three legs for all the world as if one
of his legs was broken. It was very easy
for him to play this little joke, because
he had practiced it a good deal when a
small dog got after him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear! Oh dear! Oh dear! what
shall I do?&#8221; clever Jack Rabbit shouted
back toward Ki-yi Coyote; and old Ki-yi
thought now he would surely have rabbit
for dinner. So he ran as hard as ever he
could.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha! ha!&#8221; he yelled. &#8220;I always knew
you&#8217;d break your leg some time, and I&#8217;d
get you. Ha! ha! Now I&#8217;m going to
have a nice, big, fat rabbit for dinner!&#8221;
And Ki-yi Coyote took a long, swift jump<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
to seize Jack Rabbit&mdash;but he wasn&#8217;t
there! He was farther away than ever.
And much to Ki-yi&#8217;s surprise and anger,
Jack Rabbit put all four legs down on
the ground and said as he ran, &#8220;So
you&#8217;re going to have rabbit for dinner,
are you? Well, it won&#8217;t be me, and it
won&#8217;t be Doctor Rabbit, for he&#8217;s safe.
Good day, Ki-yi; I must be going!&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i041.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">&#8220;Good day, Mr. Coyote,
I have to be going!&#8221;</p>

<p>And away Jack Rabbit went running.
But he wasn&#8217;t to get away so easily this
time, after all. Ki-yi was most terribly
angry, and he made up his mind to chase
Jack Rabbit just as long as he could
see him.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Doctor Rabbit lay
down on the cool earth in the hole, and
panted and panted. He was dreadfully
tired and frightened from his run for life.
He kept thinking that Ki-yi would
thrust his long nose into the hole and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
begin digging to get in. But Ki-yi
didn&#8217;t, of course.</p>



<p>After Doctor Rabbit had rested a few
minutes he began to be anxious to know
what had become of Friend Jack Rabbit.
Had Ki-yi by any chance caught him?
Doctor Rabbit was scared even to think
about it. He decided he would try to
find out what had happened. So he
crept very cautiously toward the opening
of the hole and peeped out. First he put
only his nose out. Then he put his whole
head out, and looked all around.</p>

<p>He had about decided that swift Jack
Rabbit had given old Ki-yi the slip.
&#8220;Guess I&#8217;d better hike for the Big Green
Woods,&#8221; said Doctor Rabbit to himself,
and he was just going to start when he
saw something that made him change
his mind mighty quick. And this time
he didn&#8217;t run for the Big Green Woods,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
either. I should say he didn&#8217;t! No, he
just backed part way into the hole under
the tree, and then stretched up his head
and watched what was coming.</p>

<p>What Doctor Rabbit saw was poor
Jack Rabbit running as hard as he could,
and Ki-yi Coyote still after him!</p>

<p>As he came on toward the tree, Jack
Rabbit shouted out ever so loud, &#8220;Doctor
Rabbit! Doctor Rabbit! Come out and
help me a little. I&#8217;m about to be caught!
It&#8217;s my rheumatism. He&#8217;s almost got
me now!&#8221; And just then Jack Rabbit
had to dodge very quickly to keep from
being caught.</p>

<p>It certainly looked very bad for poor
Jack Rabbit, and right then Ki-yi Coyote
came very near seizing him again! Doctor
Rabbit was almost too scared to
breathe. He didn&#8217;t know what on earth
to do except to spring out and let Ki-yi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
chase him instead. And he was about
to do this when he thought of something
else. So he just lay low and waited while
Jack Rabbit came running nearer and
nearer the tree.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">DOCTOR RABBIT
AND JACK RABBIT ESCAPE</h2></div>


<p>While Jack Rabbit, with Ki-yi Coyote
close after him, was running toward the
tree, Doctor Rabbit shouted out, &#8220;Come
right past this tree, Jack Rabbit! Come
right past this tree! I&#8217;ve got a plan!
Come right along, I&#8217;ll help you. Come
on! Come on!&#8221;</p>

<p>That encouraged Friend Jack Rabbit
wonderfully. He took a few extra long
jumps and managed to get a little farther
ahead of Ki-yi Coyote. Of course he
didn&#8217;t know what Doctor Rabbit was
going to do, but Jack Rabbit always had
great faith in Doctor Rabbit. So he
ran right past the hole under the tree.</p>

<p>Then, just as crafty Ki-yi was going by
with his mouth wide open and his tongue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
hanging out, Doctor Rabbit sprang up
and threw a whole bottle of his very
nastiest medicine right into Ki-yi&#8217;s face!</p>

<p>Well, you should have seen old Ki-yi
then. He was more surprised than he
ever had been before in his life. And
mad! He was about the maddest coyote
you ever heard of. His mouth had been
wide open, so of course he got most of
the medicine there. It tasted so nasty
he stopped just a moment to try to get it
out of his mouth, but when he found he
couldn&#8217;t, he started out after Doctor
Rabbit. He was angrier than ever, and
ran as hard as he could run.</p>

<p>Just as soon as Doctor Rabbit had
thrown the bad-tasting medicine in Ki-yi
Coyote&#8217;s face, he started out for the Big
Green Woods as fast as his legs could
carry him. Jack Rabbit had dodged
over a little hill and was out of sight.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>When angry Ki-yi started after him
again Doctor Rabbit was already near
the Big Green Woods, so he looked back
and just laughed and shouted. &#8220;Ha, ha,
ha!&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;I guess you&#8217;re pretty
mad, aren&#8217;t you, Mr. Ki-yi? Ha, ha,
ha! How do you like the medicine? Is
it as good as&mdash;as good as <i>jack rabbit</i>?
Ha, ha, ha!&#8221; And with that, Doctor
Rabbit bounded into the Big Green
Woods, and whisked out of sight.</p>

<p>As Doctor Rabbit ran along, he met
Jack Rabbit, who also had managed to
get into the woods. They both kept
running until they reached Doctor Rabbit&#8217;s
home in the big tree.</p>

<p>Here tired Jack Rabbit threw himself
down on the grass and panted for a long
while. He said it was about the hardest
race he ever had had in his life, and that
he guessed he must be getting old, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
he couldn&#8217;t run as fast as he used to.
But after Doctor Rabbit had brought
out some liniment and rubbed him well,
Jack Rabbit said he felt better. Then
after he had eaten a good dinner with
Doctor Rabbit, he said he felt so fine he
believed he could run away from Ki-yi
Coyote and not half try.</p>

<p>&#8220;What I need,&#8221; said Jack Rabbit, &#8220;is
a little of that liniment around the house,
so my wife could rub me with it now and
then. I believe it would cure my rheumatism.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am quite certain of it,&#8221; Doctor
Rabbit told him, and he wrapped up a
bottle of it right away and gave it to
Jack Rabbit to take home with him.
After that they sat down and talked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish,&#8221; said Jack Rabbit then,
&#8220;that there were some way to run Ki-yi
Coyote clear out of the Wide Prairie, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
some way to get rid of him altogether.&#8221;</p>

<p>Doctor Rabbit was leaning against a
tree curling his mustache and frowning
a little. When he was thinking hard, he
usually did frown. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking
about that, Friend Jack Rabbit,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;and I believe I know a way to get
rid of crafty Ki-yi, so he&#8217;ll never bother
us again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do?&#8221; exclaimed Jack Rabbit
eagerly, pricking up his long ears.
&#8220;What is your plan?&#8221;</p>

<p>Doctor Rabbit dropped his voice to a
whisper and said, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t thought it
all out yet, but I will right soon, and I&#8217;ll
let you know.&#8221; Then he looked through
the trees toward the edge of the woods,
and pointing one front foot, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Look! look! Ki-yi&#8217;s sneaking along
out there now!&#8221; Jack Rabbit looked
quickly, and sure enough, Ki-yi Coyote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
was slipping along and peering into the
woods.</p>

<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t see us at all,&#8221; whispered
Jack Rabbit, &#8220;and I think I&#8217;ll skip out
and go while I know where he is. Now,
when you decide how you&#8217;re going to run
him out of the Wide Prairie and get rid
of him, let me know, will you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I surely will,&#8221; Doctor Rabbit said,
&#8220;and I&#8217;ll have it all thought out by
morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Jack Rabbit slipped away to
tell all his friends and relatives that in
some way, he didn&#8217;t just yet know how,
Doctor Rabbit was going to get rid of
Ki-yi Coyote.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">KI-YI COYOTE WATCHES FOR
DOCTOR RABBIT</h2></div>


<p>It was just as Doctor Rabbit had expected.
He had not told Jack Rabbit
about it, but that very night Ki-yi
Coyote came prowling around, just as
Doctor Rabbit thought he would.</p>

<p>Doctor Rabbit was in bed, but he had
not gone to sleep, when he heard a noise
out in his front yard. Very quietly he
put his head out of an upstairs window.</p>

<p>Sure enough! There was slinky Ki-yi
walking around out there and mumbling
to himself. He was saying, &#8220;I know well
enough he lives here. I can smell his
tracks, and I can smell rabbit, too, as
plain as anything. He&#8217;s gone to bed
now, no doubt, so I&#8217;ll hide out here
and pay him a call in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>&#8220;He, he, he!&#8221; Ki-yi chuckled softly to
himself. He was so tickled to think he
had found where Doctor Rabbit lived.
He thought now it would be easy to surprise
Doctor Rabbit and make a breakfast
of him.</p>

<p>Only a little distance away flowed the
Murmuring Brook, where Doctor Rabbit
went every morning for a drink.</p>

<p>There was a path that led from Doctor
Rabbit&#8217;s house to the brook, and Ki-yi
Coyote thought he would hide right beside
the path in the bushes. Then when
Doctor Rabbit came along in the morning,
he could pounce upon him and have
him for breakfast.</p>

<p>So sly Ki-yi picked out a good place
near the path and lay down to wait until
morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose I&#8217;ll get pretty tired waiting,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;but a big fat rabbit for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
breakfast is worth waiting for.&#8221; And
he smacked his lips at the very thought
of it. Then he said, &#8220;My! I haven&#8217;t
tasted rabbit for two whole months.
Yes, indeed, I&#8217;ll wait right here until
morning!&#8221; And again Ki-yi smacked
his lips.</p>

<p>Now it so happened that Downy
Screech Owl was in the tree right above
Ki-yi Coyote, and heard what he said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get out of my woods!&#8221; Downy
Screech Owl cried, in his strange voice.</p>

<p>Old Ki-yi jumped, he was so startled.
Then he looked up and saw who it was.
&#8220;Never mind, Screechy,&#8221; he said, in his
smoothest voice, &#8220;I just came in for a
cool drink at the Murmuring Brook and
a little nap here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t fool me!&#8221; Downy Owl
cried back in his very strange voice.
&#8220;You&#8217;re after something, and I know it!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
I know whom you are after, too. You
are after&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>Right here Downy Screech Owl stopped
talking. He happened to think he might
say something that would get Doctor
Rabbit into trouble. So he made up his
mind to keep still for the present, and slip
over in a little while and tell Doctor
Rabbit where Ki-yi Coyote was. You
see, Downy Owl didn&#8217;t know that Doctor
Rabbit was awake. He didn&#8217;t know
that Ki-yi Coyote had even been seen
by anybody else.</p>

<p>Downy Screech Owl waited until Ki-yi
Coyote curled himself up, as if for a nap,
and then flew around to Doctor Rabbit&#8217;s
back door and knocked very gently.</p>

<p>Doctor Rabbit opened the door only
a very little crack, but when he saw who
it was, he let Downy Owl in. And
Downy began right away, for he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
very much excited: &#8220;Ki-yi Coyote is
right out there, hiding by the path, waiting
for you!&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>But to his surprise, Doctor Rabbit
answered, &#8220;I know it. I&#8217;ve been watching
him all the time!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My, I&#8217;m certainly glad you have,&#8221;
said Downy Screech Owl; &#8220;but what are
you going to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk so loud!&#8221; Doctor Rabbit
warned. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to do this: I&#8217;m
going to fool old Ki-yi worse than he
ever was fooled before in his life. The
first joke I play on him will be funny.
But the second joke I play on him will
take him clear away from the Big Green
Woods and the Wide Prairie for good
and all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My goodness me!&#8221; was all Downy
Screech Owl could say, he was so puzzled.
&#8220;How are you going to play the jokes on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
sly Ki-yi, and what are the jokes?&#8221; he
wanted to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind now,&#8221; Doctor Rabbit
whispered; &#8220;you just slip back and see
if Ki-yi is still there. If he is, try to
keep him there.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">DOCTOR RABBIT CALLS ON
CHATTY SQUIRREL</h2></div>


<p>Little Downy Owl flew back to the tree.
There was Ki-yi Coyote still lying below
on the grass, all curled up just as if he
were fast asleep. Downy Screech Owl
looked at him for a while and then, out
of curiosity, flew down on a limb a little
closer. Still Ki-yi Coyote did not move,
so Downy Owl flew a little closer. Just
then he saw sly Ki-yi move his ear the
tiniest bit, and heard him mumble something
to himself. Little Downy flew up
high in the tree as quick as winking.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll just wait,&#8221; he said very softly to
himself, &#8220;and if old Ki-yi starts to go
away, I&#8217;ll talk to him and try to keep
him here until I see what Doctor Rabbit
is going to do.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>When it was almost morning, Doctor
Rabbit got out of bed and peeped out
toward the place where Ki-yi had been.
Yes, sir! He was still there. Indeed, he
was. Doctor Rabbit saw him stretch
his head up and look toward the house
in the tree.</p>

<p>Doctor Rabbit was so tickled he just
laughed to himself. Then he slipped out
at his back door and went very quietly
through the woods until he came to the
tree where Chatty Red Squirrel lived.</p>

<p>Chatty Red was still asleep, but when
Doctor Rabbit thumped on the door, he
came down to see who was there. When
he saw Doctor Rabbit, he said, &#8220;Anyone
sick over this way, Doctor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Doctor Rabbit, &#8220;I just
wanted you to help me out a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly will, if I can,&#8221; Chatty
Squirrel said. You see, he had once had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
the colic very bad, and Doctor Rabbit
had come right over and cured him, so
he felt deeply grateful. &#8220;What do you
want me to do?&#8221; Chatty asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Doctor Rabbit said, &#8220;first I
want to tell you that Ki-yi Coyote is in
the Big Green Woods. In fact, he&#8217;s
hiding near my house this very minute,
and expects to make a breakfast of me
when I go down to the Murmuring
Brook for a drink.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sakes alive!&#8221; Chatty exclaimed.
&#8220;How did you find out?&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Doctor Rabbit told him that he
had been awake and listening, and that
Downy Screech Owl was up in the tree
watching Ki-yi, and if necessary would
talk to him to keep him there.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i061.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">&#8220;Sakes alive!&#8221;
Mr. Squirrel exclaimed.
&#8220;How did you find out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, well, well!&#8221; exclaimed Chatty
Squirrel, rubbing his eyes. He had
hardly been awake when Doctor Rabbit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
knocked on the door, but now he was
getting wider awake every minute.
&#8220;What do you want me to do?&#8221; Chatty
asked again, with his eyes wide open
and very bright.</p>

<p>&#8220;First I want to play a joke on him,&#8221;
said Doctor Rabbit, &#8220;and I&#8217;ll tell you
how to do it. Ki-yi is now right under
that big elm tree between my house and
the Murmuring Brook. You slip over
through the trees as quick as you can
and climb up to that old nest Jim Crow
used to live in. There&#8217;s a stone in the
nest that Farmer Roe&#8217;s boy threw at
you the other day. Do you remember?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed I do remember, because
Farmer Roe&#8217;s boy almost hit me with
that stone,&#8221; Chatty Squirrel said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well, then,&#8221; said Doctor Rabbit,
&#8220;you get into that nest and get hold of
that stone, and when you have a good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
chance, drop it down right on Ki-yi
Coyote. Then lie flat on the limb and
keep perfectly still, so he won&#8217;t know
where the stone came from.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But where are you going to be, and
what will you do?&#8221; Chatty Squirrel
wanted to know. He was very nervous
about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You wait and see; I&#8217;ll attend to that,&#8221;
Doctor Rabbit said softly. &#8220;And now
you hurry along before Ki-yi Coyote
decides to go away.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">FOOLING KI-YI COYOTE</h2></div>


<p>Chatty Red Squirrel remembered well
enough how Farmer Roe&#8217;s boy had
thrown that rock up at him a few days
before when he had taken refuge in Jim
Crow&#8217;s old nest.</p>

<p>It so happened that Chatty Squirrel
was not much hurt. In fact he was only
bruised a little when the stone fell into
the nest. But he had been badly scared&mdash;indeed
he had, because the stone was
big enough to do him terrible harm if it
had struck him squarely.</p>

<p>Chatty Squirrel thought it would be a
mighty fine joke to slip over and drop
that stone on Ki-yi Coyote. He naturally
hated old Ki-yi as much as anybody,
because for breakfast&mdash;or just any time&mdash;Ki-yi
was quite as fond of tender<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
squirrel as he was of fat little rabbit or
juicy little owl.</p>

<p>So when Doctor Rabbit slipped away
toward a little bridge over the Murmuring
Brook, Chatty Squirrel started off
through the tree tops toward the big elm
under which Ki-yi Coyote lay waiting.</p>

<p>It was just daylight when Chatty Red
reached the big elm and got into the old
crow&#8217;s nest where the stone was. He
peeped over the edge of the nest and
down. Yes, sir! There was old Ki-yi
Coyote! He had his ears pricked up,
and he was squinting through the trees
toward Doctor Rabbit&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll come this way now, very soon!&#8221;
greedy Ki-yi said, and smacked his lips.
Chatty heard him, and was so angry
he almost scolded out loud. But he
didn&#8217;t. He kept perfectly still and
thought about the stone. Ki-yi Coyote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
moved a little, and now he was right
under the old crow&#8217;s nest.</p>

<p>Chatty Red wondered where Doctor
Rabbit was, and looked down on the
ground and all around, but he couldn&#8217;t
see him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll obey orders, anyway,&#8221; Chatty
whispered to himself, and he got his
nose under the stone and began to work
it toward the edge of the nest.</p>

<p>Ki-yi Coyote didn&#8217;t know what was
going on, of course, so he just lay still,
smacked his lips, and kept a sharp eye
on Doctor Rabbit&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>After a little work, Chatty Squirrel got
the stone to the edge of the nest, and then
just as Ki-yi Coyote stretched his head
a little, Chatty pushed the big stone
over. <i>Kerplunk!</i> the stone hit Ki-yi
right on the ear! Well, he was about
the scaredest coyote that ever was. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
yelped and sprang up in the air, and
jumped all around.</p>

<p>Then right from the other side of the
Murmuring Brook came the voice of
Doctor Rabbit. &#8220;Ha, ha, ha! Well,
well, foxy Ki-yi, what made you jump
so? Ha, ha, ha! guess you didn&#8217;t know
I could throw so straight! Ha, ha, ha!&#8221;</p>

<p>Naturally Ki-yi Coyote thought Doctor
Rabbit <i>had</i> thrown the stone, and he
was terribly angry. Away he started.
Yes, sir, he just ground his teeth and
said he certainly would get Doctor
Rabbit, and get him in a hurry, too.
But luckily Murmuring Brook was between
them, so Doctor Rabbit laughed
and shouted again and darted out of
sight in the woods.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">KI-YI COYOTE CHASES
DOCTOR RABBIT</h2></div>


<p>As soon as Ki-yi Coyote started after
Doctor Rabbit, Chatty Squirrel began
scolding as hard as he could. Ki-yi
was running so fast he didn&#8217;t hear, but
Chatty scolded anyway. It seemed to
relieve his angry feelings.</p>

<p>My! How angry Chatty Squirrel was!
He was angrier than he had ever been in
all his life before.</p>

<p>&#8220;The idea,&#8221; Chatty Squirrel scolded,
&#8220;of Ki-yi Coyote&#8217;s coming into the Big
Green Woods to make a breakfast of
Doctor Rabbit! And he would make a
breakfast of me, too, or of Blue Jay, or
of any of us, if he had a chance. I wish
I were as big as the big brown bear for
a minute. I&#8217;d show old Ki-yi Coyote!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>And Chatty Squirrel scolded so fast
and so loud that presently his neighbors
heard him and came flocking around to
see what the trouble was.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that you say?&#8221; asked Stubby
Woodchuck, running up to the foot of
the tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that? What&#8217;s that? What&#8217;s
that?&#8221; cried Blue Jay, and Jim Crow,
and ever so many others as they came up.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better say, &#8216;What&#8217;s that?&#8217;&#8221;
Chatty Squirrel chattered. &#8220;I just now
dropped a stone on Ki-yi Coyote, who
was lying right down there in those
bushes. He was all ready to pounce on
Doctor Rabbit and gobble him up!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed!&#8221; exclaimed Blue Jay in his
shrill voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed!&#8221; Jim Crow called in his
hoarse voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed!&#8221; said big Uncle Owl in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
deep bass voice. &#8220;Indeed! Indeed!&#8221;
he exclaimed again seriously, as he
straightened his spectacles. Now Uncle
Owl hardly ever said more than one word,
and when he said <i>three</i> words without
stopping, it meant something very unusual
had happened to him. He was
<i>almost</i> excited.</p>

<p>All the little creatures of the Big Green
Woods kept a respectful silence, even
Chatty Squirrel, and listened respectfully
for Uncle Owl to speak. So big
Uncle Owl (he was more than twice as
big as little Downy Owl) cleared his
throat and looked straight at Chatty
Squirrel. Then he said, &#8220;Well, well,
why didn&#8217;t you <i>kill</i> him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could have killed him,&#8221;
Chatty Squirrel chattered angrily. &#8220;But
anyway I hit him. And Doctor Rabbit
fooled him ever so much, because, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
see, Doctor Rabbit was on the other side
of Murmuring Brook and ran away from
Ki-yi as easily as anything. But what
are we going to do?&#8221; Chatty went on.
&#8220;Haven&#8217;t we got enough to do to live
without having old Ki-yi Coyote sneaking
around in the Big Green Woods? I
tell you, my friends, it&#8217;s an outrage!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then they all looked at big Uncle
Owl, and after a while he said in his deep
voice, &#8220;My friends, I think we should
have Doctor Rabbit call a meeting at
once and see if we can&#8217;t get rid of this
danger. It would be serious, very serious
indeed, if Ki-yi Coyote should decide
to live in the Big Green Woods. He
might make a meal of almost any of us.
I&#8217;ve noticed that he is not at all particular
what he eats, whether it&#8217;s a bird or an
animal. Only yesterday I saw him spring
from some bunch grass in the prairie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
and seize a friend of mine, a small owl
that had just come out of an old hole
prairie-dog Paddy-Paws used to live in.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed,&#8221; old Uncle Owl went
on, much excited for him, &#8220;yes, indeed!
We must find Doctor Rabbit, and see
what he has to say about it. I&#8217;ll not
rest until this terrible Ki-yi Coyote is
driven entirely away from our Big Green
Woods.&#8221; And with that, stately Uncle
Owl waddled back to his hole in the tree,
where he stood looking out.</p>

<p>The other little creatures of the Big
Green Woods then talked the matter
over. Blue Jay said that if only they
all could make as much noise as he could,
he was sure they could drive Ki-yi Coyote
away with noise alone. But since
the others couldn&#8217;t make as much
noise, this plan had to be given up.</p>

<p>Gay Red Bird said he surely did wish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
he could think of some scheme to scare
Ki-yi away, but being a mere bird
he couldn&#8217;t. Robin-the-Red said so too.
Stubby Woodchuck and Cheepy Chipmunk
both said they&#8217;d like to do it, but
they didn&#8217;t know how, either. They
all looked at one another, and each one
waited for some one else to speak. And
just then they saw Doctor Rabbit coming
across the woods toward them.</p>

<p>He wasn&#8217;t running as if he were the
least bit scared. Oh, no, he was acting
as if he were glad about something.
There was no doubt about that, because
every now and then he would kick up
his heels and laugh. And the nearer he
came the more he danced and laughed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">DOCTOR RABBIT HAS A SCHEME</h2></div>


<p>Doctor Rabbit came up jumping and
dancing and laughing. He was certainly
very much tickled about something, that
was plain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning, my friends,&#8221; he said
finally. &#8220;I suppose you all have come
out here to see what Chatty Squirrel is
scolding about. Has he told you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, about Ki-yi Coyote!&#8221; they
all said together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Doctor Rabbit said, and he
laughed again, &#8220;I gave old Ki-yi the
slip pretty easily that time. Indeed I
did, and Chatty Squirrel and I certainly
did fool him! I guess we did fool him!
Ha, ha, ha!&#8221; And Doctor Rabbit was
so tickled he just had to hold his sides
when he remembered how Ki-yi Coyote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
had jumped, and how puzzled he had
looked when the stone hit him.</p>

<p>&#8220;The last I saw of him,&#8221; Doctor Rabbit
said, &#8220;he was sneaking along the Wide
Prairie at the edge of the woods, looking
for Jack Rabbit; and he was mumbling
to himself and saying he was going to
get me and Jack Rabbit too. But I&#8217;ll
take care of that. He thinks I&#8217;m not
smart enough for him, but just let him
wait and see! When I ran away from
him and got into the briar patch, he
shouted in at me and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;All right for this time, Doctor Rabbit,
but I&#8217;ll get you the next time, and
some of your friends, too. In fact, I
think I like the Big Green Woods, and
I&#8217;m going to live here. Perhaps I&#8217;ll live
here right along!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i077.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">Dr. Rabbit ... was
certainly tickled about something</p>

<p>That troubled everybody but Doctor

the Big Green Woods looked seriously
at one another, and Stubby Woodchuck
climbed up on a stump and looked
nervously around. &#8220;I wish we could
drive Ki-yi Coyote ten miles away, and
I wish he never could get back!&#8221; Stubby
Woodchuck said, with a very scared
look on his face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s do it!&#8221; shouted Blue Jay.
Blue Jay didn&#8217;t have the least idea how
it could be done, but he was willing to
try, even as small as he was.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps Doctor Rabbit has a plan,&#8221;
said Robin-the-Red. &#8220;He usually helps
us out.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then they all looked at Doctor Rabbit.
Even old Uncle Owl looked from his
hole in the tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Doctor Rabbit, cheerfully,
&#8220;I have been thinking about this
since yesterday. First I thought out a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
way for us to catch Ki-yi, but that would
be pretty dangerous for us, so I have
decided to try another plan. I think
my scheme will work, and none of us
will have to get very close to Ki-yi
Coyote, either. In fact, I think Jack
Rabbit and I can do it ourselves, though
we shall need the help of one very savage
creature. I will tell you about him
later.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s do it right now!&#8221; shouted busy
Blue Jay.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; Doctor Rabbit said, &#8220;it will
take a little time. I&#8217;m going over to
see Jack Rabbit this very afternoon,&#8221;
he continued. &#8220;After I have talked
with him and we are all ready, I&#8217;ll tell
Friend Blue Jay and he&#8217;ll tell you.
Then all you&#8217;ll need to do will be to come
close to this big tree, and hide, and
watch. You must excuse me now,&#8221; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
said. &#8220;I must go over and see one of
Frisky Grey Squirrel&#8217;s children who has
been eating too many green nuts. Early
in the morning Blue Jay will tell you
when we shall be ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>And with that Doctor Rabbit went
away, hoppity, hoppity, hoppity, to see
the little sick squirrel.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE LITTLE CREATURES OF THE
WOODS ARE EXCITED</h2></div>


<p>The next day all the little creatures of
the Big Green Woods talked of nothing
but fierce Ki-yi Coyote. They wondered
how Doctor Rabbit ever would drive
him out of the Wide Prairie. They
were all unusually careful, of course,
because they did not know what moment
Ki-yi Coyote might come tearing along.</p>

<p>Stubby Woodchuck was afraid to get
up on his stump to sun himself. He
only put his head a little way out of his
door and looked around. Cheepy Chipmunk
was frisking around his stump and,
seeing his neighbor, Stubby Woodchuck,
he called out, &#8220;Come on over, Friend
Stubby. I have some fine vegetables for
breakfast!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>&#8220;No, thank you,&#8221; Stubby Woodchuck
said from his doorway. &#8220;We had all
better keep indoors until that dreadful
Ki-yi Coyote leaves the woods entirely,&#8221;
and Stubby closed his door and went
back into his kitchen, for he had not
had his breakfast.</p>

<p>While Cheepy Chipmunk was frisking
around he got a terrible scare. He had
just jumped up on his stump when he
was sure he saw Ki-yi&#8217;s long tail showing
from behind a near-by tree. Poor
Cheepy fell off backward, he was so
scared. He picked himself up as fast as
he could, but when he looked again,
he saw it was only Chatty Red Squirrel&#8217;s
tail, blowing from behind the tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cheer! cheer! cheer!&#8221; shouted Blue
Jay, who had seen Cheepy Chipmunk
fall off the stump. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter,
Cheepy? Ha, ha, ha!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>&#8220;You&#8217;d better go and attend to your
business, if you have any,&#8221; retorted
Cheepy Chipmunk angrily. But saucy
Blue Jay only laughed again. He understood
Cheepy Chipmunk, and he knew
he would not stay angry very long.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll wager anything you fell because
you thought you saw Ki-yi Coyote,&#8221;
shouted saucy Blue Jay; &#8220;I&#8217;m going out
to see where he is!&#8221; And away he flew.</p>

<p>Cheepy Chipmunk went inside, where
Mrs. Chipmunk was getting the vegetables
ready for breakfast. Little Jimmy
Chipmunk, Cheepy and Mrs. Cheepy&#8217;s
small son, was running around after his
mother as she worked, and asking her
questions. He had never seen Ki-yi
Coyote, and so had no idea about his
size. &#8220;Mamma,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;is Ki-yi
Coyote as big as one of Farmer Roe&#8217;s
horses?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>&#8220;Why, of course not,&#8221; Mother Chipmunk
answered. &#8220;But he&#8217;s big enough,
and fierce enough too, for that matter;
and for the present you must not so much
as poke your nose outside the door.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will Doctor Rabbit find some way to
drive Ki-yi Coyote out of the Big Green
Woods?&#8221; Jimmy Chipmunk asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe he will; I do hope so,&#8221;
Mother Chipmunk said. She was a
good deal worried about Jimmy Chipmunk,
because he was so often careless,
and went out without telling her a thing
about it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish,&#8221; said Jimmy, crossly, &#8220;that
old Ki-yi would fall down a well so deep
he never could climb out again. I just
hate to stay in the house. I want to go
over right now and play with Johnny
Woodchuck. I told him I&#8217;d come this
morning.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t let you go for the world,&#8221;
Mother Chipmunk said; and then, very
quietly, she slipped out at the back door
and climbed up on the stump. But the
minute she got up on the stump she
nearly fell off backward, she was so
scared. You see, Mother Chipmunk&#8217;s
near neighbor climbed up on <i>her</i> stump
at the very same time, and they were
both so surprised to see each other
that they were dreadfully frightened.</p>

<p>&#8220;My sakes alive!&#8221; Sophy Woodchuck&#8217;s
voice trembled. &#8220;How you did frighten
me, Neighbor Chipmunk! I suppose we
all are pretty easily frightened at this
time. One never knows when that
terrible Ki-yi Coyote will spring out and
make an end of us!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have great faith in Doctor Rabbit,&#8221;
Mother Chipmunk said. She had overheard
what Doctor Rabbit had promised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
the day before. &#8220;He told us yesterday,&#8221;
she continued, &#8220;that he will drive Ki-yi
Coyote clear out of the Big Green Woods
and clear out of the Wide Prairie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder how in the world he will do
it!&#8221; Sophy Woodchuck said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t the slightest idea,&#8221; her
neighbor replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Sophy Woodchuck said, &#8220;we
don&#8217;t care how he does it, so long as the
thing is done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed!&#8221; Mother Chipmunk exclaimed.
&#8220;If only Ki-yi Coyote is driven
away.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">DOCTOR RABBIT TALKS WITH
BIG DOG YAPPY</h2></div>


<p>You remember how badly scared Sophy
Woodchuck and Neighbor Chipmunk
were when they both climbed up on their
stumps at the same time. Well, after
their scare was over, they sat on their
stumps&mdash;which were their homes, of
course&mdash;and went on talking about various
things that had happened among
their neighbors of late; but in particular
they talked about the terrible Ki-yi
Coyote.</p>

<p>Then all of a sudden something happened
that made them jump off their
stumps, and dart in at their back doors
and lock them in a hurry.</p>

<p>They had heard some animal tearing
through the woods, apparently straight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
at them. As they peeked from their
windows they naturally thought it was
Ki-yi Coyote. But it wasn&#8217;t. Ki-yi
Coyote would have been far too smart to
make so much noise. No, it was Farmer
Roe&#8217;s big dog, Yappy.</p>

<p>Yappy wasn&#8217;t running after anything
in particular. He was just running
through the woods to take a little exercise
and enjoy himself.</p>

<p>Yappy ran around for a time while the
little creatures of the Big Green Woods
hid and looked out at him. After he
had scratched on Cheepy Chipmunk&#8217;s
door and tried to dig into Stubby Woodchuck&#8217;s
home, Yappy started out of
the woods as fast as he had come in.</p>

<p>Just as he passed Doctor Rabbit&#8217;s
house, Doctor Rabbit put his head out
of a hole pretty well up in the tree and
said, &#8220;Good morning, Yappy!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>Happy Yappy stopped mighty quick
and looked all around. He couldn&#8217;t see
anybody at first, and he wondered who
it was that had spoken. Stubby and
Mrs. Stubby and Cheepy and Mrs.
Cheepy came to their windows to peek
out and listen. Robin-the-Red, Jim
Crow, and ever so many other of the little
creatures of the Big Green Woods also
listened. They wondered what Doctor
Rabbit would say to Yappy.</p>

<p>After gazing around and up a little,
Yappy at last saw Doctor Rabbit looking
from the hole up in the tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, good morning, Doctor!&#8221; Yappy
said, in his pleasantest voice. &#8220;Come
down on the grass here; you will be more
comfortable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, thank you,&#8221; Doctor Rabbit said,
&#8220;I&#8217;d rather talk from up here. You
look pretty hungry, and I just wanted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
ask you how you would like to have Jack
Rabbit for your breakfast to-morrow
morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>This was a question that was a little
hard for Yappy to answer, under the
circumstances. Rabbit was his favorite
dish, when he could get one. He saw he
could not get Doctor Rabbit, and he
thought Doctor Rabbit was just making
fun of him. Of course, Yappy was
pretty angry. He was all the more angry
because, although he had chased Jack
Rabbit many times, he never had been
able to catch him. Still, he was always
willing to try again.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s all right about my wanting
Jack Rabbit,&#8221; Yappy snapped; &#8220;I could
catch him in no time if I <i>wanted</i> to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Doctor Rabbit almost laughed out loud
at this, but he didn&#8217;t, because that might
have spoiled what he wanted to do.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>&#8220;Why, of course,&#8221; Doctor Rabbit said
in his most friendly tones. &#8220;And I have
decided I&#8217;ll give you a chance at him.
In fact, I have been watching for you to
tell you this very thing. Now, all you
have to do,&#8221; Doctor Rabbit continued,
&#8220;is to go where I tell you, and when I
tell you, and you will run right on to
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yappy was certainly puzzled about
this matter. Why, he wondered, did
Doctor Rabbit want to get rid of Jack
Rabbit? &#8220;Oh, well,&#8221; Yappy thought to
himself, &#8220;perhaps Jack Rabbit has been
over in the Big Green Woods cuffing
Doctor Rabbit; or maybe it is just because
Doctor Rabbit is angry at Jack
Rabbit for something or other he&#8217;s
done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well&#8221;&mdash;and Yappy tried to say it
as if he was not very much interested&mdash;&#8220;Well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
I don&#8217;t care much, but if you want
to, you may tell me when and where I
can find him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; said Doctor Rabbit, and then
he continued, &#8220;He&#8217;ll be in a new burrow
right by the first tree you come to
out in the Wide Prairie. And he&#8217;ll be
there to-morrow morning at exactly nine
o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know that?&#8221; Yappy
asked with deep curiosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind how I know,&#8221; Doctor
Rabbit retorted. &#8220;He&#8217;ll be there as sure
as anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yappy yawned as if it didn&#8217;t make
much difference to him. Then he said,
&#8220;Well, I guess I&#8217;ll be moving,&#8221; and
away he ran through the woods until he
was out of sight.</p>

<p>Doctor Rabbit chuckled to himself.
He knew mighty well that Yappy <i>was</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
interested, even if he did try to act as
if he didn&#8217;t care. And he knew the
greedy fellow would be at that tree at
nine the next morning, too.</p>

<p>Of course the other little creatures of
the Big Green Woods were much puzzled
that Doctor Rabbit should seem to have
turned so quickly against Jack Rabbit.
But the next morning they found out all
about it. And something happened of
which they had never even dreamed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">DOCTOR RABBIT TALKS WITH
JACK RABBIT</h2></div>


<p>You remember how Doctor Rabbit
looked out of a hole and told Farmer
Roe&#8217;s dog Yappy about catching Jack
Rabbit. Well, after Yappy had run
away and was out of sight in the woods,
Doctor Rabbit concluded he&#8217;d better
see Jack Rabbit right away. So he
slipped quietly out of his house and ran
through the woods toward the Wide
Prairie.</p>

<p>Doctor Rabbit was lucky, because
Jack Rabbit happened to be right on the
edge of the woods. And Jack Rabbit
said his son Billy was very much better.
&#8220;I am very grateful,&#8221; continued Jack
Rabbit, &#8220;and I wish I could do something
now to make you as happy as I am.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>&#8220;You certainly can,&#8221; Doctor Rabbit
said. &#8220;Do you remember the day Ki-yi
Coyote chased us out on the Wide
Prairie, and I threw the medicine in his
mouth?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly do,&#8221; said Jack Rabbit.
&#8220;And when we got safely over to your
house, you said you were thinking about
a plan to drive Ki-yi Coyote clear away
from the Big Green Woods and the Wide
Prairie forever. Is that what you want
me to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Doctor Rabbit, &#8220;that&#8217;s
exactly what I was going to speak about.
I want you to help me. Will you do it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; declared Jack Rabbit, &#8220;I
should say I will, if I can. But how can
I help? All you need to do is to tell me
what to do and I will do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be too sure you will,&#8221; Doctor
Rabbit warned in a friendly way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
&#8220;What I want you to do has some danger
in it. Are you much afraid of Farmer
Roe&#8217;s Yappy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, why, of course,&#8221; Jack Rabbit
hesitated; &#8220;that is, I&mdash;I&mdash;wouldn&#8217;t
want to fight him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha, ha, ha!&#8221; Doctor Rabbit couldn&#8217;t
keep from laughing at the idea of Jack
Rabbit&#8217;s fighting Yappy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want you to fight him,&#8221; Doctor
Rabbit said, &#8220;but would you be
willing to let him chase you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely,&#8221; exclaimed Jack Rabbit
quickly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve given him the slip many
a time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose,&#8221; said Doctor Rabbit, &#8220;that
Yappy and one of his dog friends both
should get after you, could you get
away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; Jack Rabbit said; &#8220;I&#8217;ve
given both of those hounds the slip.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
They are just fox hounds, and I&#8217;m not
the least bit afraid when they get after
me. But what has that to do with
driving Ki-yi Coyote away?&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i099.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">Mr. Jack Rabbit began to dance
a little jig of joy</p>

<p>&#8220;Just this,&#8221; said Doctor Rabbit, moving
a little closer. &#8220;At nine o&#8217;clock
to-morrow morning Ki-yi Coyote is going
to be right under that big elm where he
was this morning, to catch me. Chatty
Squirrel heard him say he was. He said,
&#8216;Yes, I&#8217;ll come every morning and hide
there until I do catch that big fat rabbit&#8217;&mdash;meaning
me, of course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I see! I see!&#8221; laughed Jack
Rabbit, and he began to dance a little
jig of joy. &#8220;I know what you want me
to do,&#8221; Jack Rabbit laughed. &#8220;You
want me to let big old Yappy and his
friend get after me, and then you want
me to run straight for that big elm, and
so lead Yappy and the other hound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
right onto old Ki-yi. And then they
will chase him instead of me!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it! that&#8217;s it!&#8221; said Doctor
Rabbit. He was mighty glad that Jack
Rabbit did not seem at all afraid.
&#8220;And,&#8221; Doctor Rabbit continued, &#8220;when
Yappy and his companion once see Ki-yi
Coyote, they will forget all about you,
and you can get away as easily as anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, ho, ho, ho! ha, ha, ha!&#8221; laughed
Jack Rabbit. It seemed too good to
be true that they could fool crafty Ki-yi,
and fool him so completely. Old Ki-yi,
who was always getting the best of
things, would now get some of the other
side. So thought happy Jack-Rabbit.</p>

<p>&#8220;That certainly will be mighty fine!&#8221;
cried Jack Rabbit. &#8220;Ki-yi Coyote will
be there, smacking his lips, all ready to
gobble you up; and the first thing he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
knows, I&#8217;ll pop square over him, and the
next second, Yappy will pop square onto
him, if he doesn&#8217;t move mighty quick.
Ho, ho, ho!&#8221; Jack Rabbit danced and
laughed some more. &#8220;Yes, indeed, Doctor
Rabbit,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I&#8217;ll surely be at
the tree in the Wide Prairie to-morrow
morning at nine o&#8217;clock. Then be sure
to tell all the little creatures of the Big
Green Woods to watch and see what
happens.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will indeed,&#8221; said Doctor Rabbit,
as he started off; &#8220;and thank you,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;for your bravery.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">OLD UNCLE OWL GIVES
GOOD ADVICE</h2></div>


<p>You remember how Doctor Rabbit
asked Jack Rabbit to do a rather risky
thing to drive Ki-yi Coyote out of the
Big Green Woods. Well, the next morning
after this, Friend Jack Rabbit was
up a good while before daylight. To
tell the truth, he had not slept very
much during the night. No, sir; he just
couldn&#8217;t get to sleep because he kept
thinking about that joke he and Doctor
Rabbit were to play on wicked old
Ki-yi Coyote.</p>

<p>Of course, it was not all fun, either. I
should say not! You see, greedy Yappy
would certainly gobble up Jack Rabbit
if he could get him. But Jack Rabbit
was not very much afraid, because he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
had run away from Yappy a good many
times before.</p>

<p>No, brave Jack Rabbit didn&#8217;t stay
awake because he was scared. I suppose
he couldn&#8217;t sleep for about the same
reason that boys sometimes stay awake
when the circus comes to town. And the
boys used to get up before daylight to
go and see the animals, and perhaps some
of them do it yet.</p>

<p>Yes, Jack Rabbit was very, very curious.
He wondered if Ki-yi Coyote would
really hide in the Big Green Woods under
the elm tree, as Doctor Rabbit had said
he would.</p>

<p>So, about four in the morning, Jack
Rabbit slipped away and went over to
watch along the edge of the woods. He
had not been there long when, yes, sir;
Sure enough! There came Ki-yi Coyote
sneaking along and looking all around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
to make sure, as he thought, that nobody
saw him.</p>

<p>As slinky Ki-yi Coyote slipped along
he came pretty close to Jack Rabbit, and
then Jack Rabbit lay mighty still. Indeed
he did! He hardly dared to breathe
until Ki-yi Coyote had passed from sight
beneath the big elm farther on in the
woods. Then Jack Rabbit just kicked
up his heels and danced for joy. He
wanted to laugh too, ever so much, but
he didn&#8217;t dare, because sharp-eared
Ki-yi might hear him. No, Jack Rabbit
ran clear back to his tree before he
laughed, and then he laughed as loudly
as he wanted to. &#8220;I can scarcely wait
until nine o&#8217;clock comes,&#8221; he said, after
he had laughed again and danced another
jig of joy.</p>

<p>Stubby Woodchuck had heard Doctor
Rabbit talking with Yappy, and so as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
often as Stubby saw one of the little
creatures of the Big Green Woods, he
told him about it. It was not long
before every one of them knew, and they
wondered why kind Doctor Rabbit had
told Yappy where to find Jack Rabbit.
In fact, they really couldn&#8217;t understand
it at all, because Doctor Rabbit was so
good and kind to everybody.</p>

<p>But when Uncle Owl heard about it,
he looked very wise and said to a number
of the little creatures of the Big Green
Woods, &#8220;I&#8217;m sure you need not be
troubled, my friends; for I think we shall
find that this has something to do with
getting Ki-yi Coyote away from the Big
Green Woods and the Wide Prairie.
Bear in mind, I say I only <i>suspect</i> it
does,&#8221; and with another very wise look
Uncle Owl walked back to his hole in the
tree, and there stood looking toward the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
big elm where Ki-yi Coyote lay hiding
and watching for Doctor Rabbit.</p>

<p>Then about a half hour before nine
o&#8217;clock, busy Blue Jay flew all over the
Big Green Woods and told all the little
creatures of the woods to go as close as
they dared to the big elm where Ki-yi
Coyote lay, and then watch.</p>

<p>When some of them tried to have Blue
Jay stop and talk, he said he didn&#8217;t
have time. He said he was in the biggest
hurry he had ever known. &#8220;You watch!
You watch!&#8221; he would cry back at them
as he flew away to tell others.</p>

<p>Before long they were all either flying
or creeping toward the big elm. They
didn&#8217;t know what Doctor Rabbit&#8217;s plan
was, of course, but they believed something
mighty interesting was going to
happen. When they were all hidden,
some of them kept up such a whispering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
it seemed as if Ki-yi must surely hear.
Each one said it wasn&#8217;t he who whispered,
until presently Uncle Owl called
out loudly from his tree, &#8220;<i>Who?</i>&#8221; Then
they did keep still. Because there was
Uncle Owl looking right at them.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">YAPPY CHASES KI-YI COYOTE</h2></div>


<p>All the little creatures of the Big
Green Woods were looking toward the
big elm where Ki-yi Coyote was hiding
and were wondering what would happen.</p>

<p>Then all of a sudden they heard big-mouthed
Yappy baying away out on the
Wide Prairie. Pretty soon they heard
another hound baying.</p>

<p>It was quite true that Jack Rabbit
had been started up at last. He had
waited at the tree, and it had seemed as
though nine o&#8217;clock never would come.
At last when he saw Yappy and his
friend coming, he was really glad.</p>

<p>When they were pretty close, Jack
Rabbit sprang up, put his long ears
straight in the air, and away he went.
You see, when he doesn&#8217;t have to run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
very fast, he keeps his ears straight up
in the air; but when he has to run as fast
as he can&mdash;the way he did when Speedy
Grey Hound got after him&mdash;then he
lays his long ears down flat to his head.
And how he does run! He looks like a
streak, he goes so fast.</p>

<p>Jack Rabbit was not much afraid of
Yappy, because you see, Yappy was only
a fox hound. Now a fox hound is dangerous
enough at night, when he is on
the trail of Ray Coon or O. Possum, but
he can&#8217;t do any harm in the daytime to
swift Jack Rabbit on the Wide Prairie.</p>

<p>Big Yappy and his friend, the other
fox hound, had been trained to trail,
at night, nothing but Ray Coon and O.
Possum and Tom Wildcat. But in the
daytime they certainly did like to start
up Jack Rabbit. Most of all, though,
they liked to start up Ki-yi Coyote.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>&#8220;There he goes!&#8221; shouted happy
Yappy to his friend, as Jack Rabbit
jumped up; and away they all went.
And Jack Rabbit, of course, led them
straight away for the Big Green Woods.</p>

<p>As they ran, Jack Rabbit kept thinking
to himself, &#8220;I surely do hate to run so
close to Ki-yi Coyote. Indeed, I do!
Just suppose he <i>should</i> go after me as
hard as ever he could.&#8221; Then he would
comfort himself by thinking, &#8220;But then,
he&#8217;ll never do it with the two hounds
chasing him. I&#8217;ll be all right. Yes,
I&#8217;ll just keep going. My, but I wish
I could kick old Ki-yi right on the nose
as I go past him!&#8221;</p>

<p>But wise Jack Rabbit said to himself
that as soon as he had started up Ki-yi
Coyote, he would run right back to the
Wide Prairie, where there was plenty of
room, because he might need it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>While all the little creatures of the Big
Green Woods were looking and wondering,
Doctor Rabbit bounded into the
woods from somewhere. In a jiffy he
was in his tree, looking out from an
upper window.</p>

<p>The two hounds were coming after
Jack Rabbit as fast as they could, yelling
terribly at each other, and saying that
this time they certainly would catch him.</p>

<p>But Jack Rabbit was very wise. He
ran a little slower until the two hounds
were fearfully close, and all the little
creatures of the Big Green Woods looking
on were dreadfully scared for poor Jack
Rabbit. In fact, Mother Chipmunk and
Sophy Woodchuck began to weep, and
wipe their eyes with the corners of their
aprons, because they said something had
surely gone wrong with Jack Rabbit and
this was the last of him. It would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
terrible, they said; and how would Mrs.
Jack Rabbit ever make a living for all
that family of little rabbits out on the
Wide Prairie?</p>

<p>The next minute Jack Rabbit ran
straight for the big elm. He saw Ki-yi
Coyote lying with his body close to the
ground. Old Ki-yi Coyote had seen them
coming, but he thought, of course, he
would just watch and see Jack Rabbit
and the hounds go by. Then suddenly,
before he could realize it, Jack Rabbit
leaped clear over startled Ki-yi. &#8220;Ki-yi!
Ki-yi!&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;I&#8217;ve brought you
some company. Here they are. Good
day! I must be going!&#8221; And away
went Jack Rabbit out of sight.</p>

<p>Well, Ki-yi Coyote was both surprised
and angry. He was about the angriest
he had ever been in his life. But what
could he do? Well, he couldn&#8217;t do a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
thing except tear out of the woods as
hard as he could go. And then how all
the little creatures of the Big Green
Woods did laugh, even Mother Chipmunk
and Sophy Woodchuck!</p>

<p>Now when Yappy and his friend saw
Ki-yi Coyote jump up, they shouted for
joy. &#8220;Woo! woo! woo!&#8221; shouted Yappy
gaily to his friend. &#8220;Sly old Ki-yi!
Woo, woo, woo! Here he is right under
our noses! <i>Now</i> we&#8217;ll see about him!
Woo, woo, woo!&#8221; And away they went
after Ki-yi Coyote. Ki-yi was so mad
he could have bitten a nail if there had
been one handy, but, mad or no mad,
he had to run as hard as he could.</p>

<p>Now the little creatures of the Big
Green Woods all hurried to the edge of
the woods and looked on as Yappy and
his friend started out across the Wide
Prairie after Ki-yi Coyote.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">KI-YI COYOTE&#8217;S STRANGE
HIDING PLACE</h2></div>


<p>How Ki-yi Coyote did run when he got
out on the Wide Prairie! He thought he
would run as fast as possible, and so get
out of sight and hide from the two
hounds. Sure enough, sly Ki-yi did this
very thing. He ran so fast that pretty
soon he passed from sight over a little
hill, and it certainly looked as if he had
escaped. Old Ki-yi thought he had, and
as he hid in some tall grass, he chuckled
to himself to think how easy it was to
get away from his enemies. &#8220;I&#8217;ll just
wait and rest here,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Ha, ha,
ha! I&#8217;ll get my rabbit for breakfast
yet!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Ki-yi Coyote had no more than
said that than here came Yappy and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
other hound right on his trail. And they
kept coming right on and sniffing and
smelling Ki-yi&#8217;s tracks until they were so
close that Ki-yi had to spring up and run
again. Once more he ran fast and hid,
but again he was trailed, and again he
had to jump up and run.</p>

<p>They kept this up all morning, until
Ki-yi Coyote was getting pretty tired.
Then, a little later, he was so dreadfully
tired that what do you suppose he did?
No, he didn&#8217;t stop to fight, although
cowardly Ki-yi sometimes does do that.
He thought about it, but after he had
looked back he said to himself, &#8220;No, I
won&#8217;t stop to fight. I&#8217;m not quite able
to tackle Yappy and that other big
hound, too. I&#8217;m going to do something
else. I&#8217;m going where I can rest.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i117.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption">He ran straight for
Mr. Farmer&#8217;s corn-crib</p>

<p>And he did. He ran straight for
Farmer Roe&#8217;s corn crib and squeezed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
under it! The dirt was soft and cool
under there, and tired Ki-yi stretched
out and made himself very comfortable.
Then Yappy and his friend ran up to the
hole where Ki-yi Coyote had gone under
the corn crib, and began barking for all
they were worth; and presently Farmer
Roe and his boy came out and looked
under the corn crib. They were certainly
surprised to see Ki-yi hidden under
there, and they decided at once that they
would try to catch him alive.</p>

<p>The two hounds kept on barking, and
Farmer Roe and his boy went right to
work fixing something outside; but Ki-yi
did not know what they were doing, and
he felt pretty safe.</p>

<p>All this time the little creatures of the
Big Green Woods had looked on from the
edge of the Wide Prairie. Blue Jay was
in the very top of the big elm, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
called down every now and then to tell
just what was happening.</p>

<p>When Ki-yi Coyote ran under the corn
crib, Doctor Rabbit slipped up pretty
close to Farmer Roe&#8217;s house. He got a
good hiding place in some weeds, where
he could see all that happened.</p>

<p>After a while Farmer Roe and his boy
got some kind of a box fixed, and this
they placed over the hole into which
Ki-yi Coyote had run. Then they took
the two hounds away and locked them
in the barn. Doctor Rabbit slipped back
to the woods.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve got it all fixed to catch
Ki-yi alive!&#8221; he told the other little
creatures of the Big Green Woods.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know?&#8221; they asked in
a chorus.</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard them say so; and now you
just wait and see!&#8221; Doctor Rabbit said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
Then he slipped back again to hide in
the weeds and watch.</p>

<p>Of course he had to be very careful,
because Yappy might come tearing out
into the weeds at any moment. But
Doctor Rabbit&#8217;s eyes are very sharp.
He was sure he could see any danger if
it came near, so he was not much afraid.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CATCHING KI-YI COYOTE</h2></div>


<p>All afternoon Doctor Rabbit watched
the strange box that Farmer Roe had
placed at the hole where Ki-yi Coyote
had gone under the corn crib, but nothing
happened. Toward evening Doctor Rabbit
came back to the little creatures
waiting in the woods. He looked very
wisely at them and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;My friends, nothing more has happened
as yet, but I feel quite certain that
Ki-yi Coyote will be caught. I&#8217;m pretty
tired now and must have my supper.
Just as soon as it is daylight, Jack Rabbit
and I will slip over again and watch, and
see what Farmer Roe and his boy do
about that box.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this all the little creatures of the
Big Green Woods began talking at once.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
Then they bade Doctor Rabbit good-night,
and went back to their homes to
await the news.</p>

<p>The next morning they were all startled
by hearing noisy Blue Jay shouting,
&#8220;Come here! Come here, all of you!
Doctor Rabbit told me to call you. Old
Ki-yi is caught, and I can see him. I
can see him!&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, you should have seen all those
little creatures of the Big Green Woods
tumbling out of their homes! Stubby
Woodchuck came tearing out of his front
door, and before he knew it, bumped
into Cheepy Chipmunk, and knocked
him over. They were both mad about
it for a minute. Stubby got bumped on
the ear and Cheepy got a bump on the
nose, but in the excitement they forgot
their anger and hurried to the edge of
the Wide Prairie, where all the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
little creatures of the Big Green Woods
seemed to be gathering.</p>

<p>Chatty Red Squirrel came out of his
house so fast he ran square into Frisky
Grey Squirrel, and then Neighbor Grey
was provoked. He said he never did
know a Red Squirrel that had any manners;
but Chatty Red Squirrel kept right
on running, and so Frisky Grey Squirrel
forgot his crossness and ran too, as fast
as he could, with the other excited little
creatures of the Big Green Woods.</p>

<p>In almost no time they all had reached
the edge of the woods. Then they all
looked toward Farmer Roe&#8217;s house and
the strange box.</p>

<hr class="chap" />





<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">THE LITTLE CREATURES OF
THE WOODS ARE HAPPY AGAIN</h2></div>


<p>When the little creatures of the Big
Green Woods looked toward Farmer
Roe&#8217;s house, they saw Doctor Rabbit
behind a fence post, watching.</p>

<p>Yes, it was true: Ki-yi Coyote was in
that box! They knew it because several
times they heard Farmer Roe&#8217;s boy say,
&#8220;We got him! I was sure he would
come out in the night!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then the little creatures of the Big
Green Woods wondered what Farmer
Roe was doing. He went into the barn
several times and brought out some
boards, a hammer, and a saw. First he
sawed the boards, and then he hammered
and nailed ever so long.</p>

<p>After a while all the little creatures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
of the Big Green Woods could see what
Farmer Roe was doing. He was making
a kind of wood and wire cage for Ki-yi
Coyote. When it was all ready, Farmer
Roe and his son put the cage against the
box that Ki-yi Coyote was in. Then
Farmer Roe&#8217;s boy poked Ki-yi with a
long stick and drove him into the cage.
Then as the farmer and his boy stood
looking at dusty Ki-yi in the cage, they
talked for quite a long time; but the
little creatures of the Big Green Woods
could not hear what was said. At last
Farmer Roe and his boy went into the
house. Then wise Doctor Rabbit came
running back to the woods and said it
was mighty fine the way things were
turning out.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are going to load Ki-yi Coyote
into a wagon, take him to the city, and
sell him to the men who have charge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
a big park there,&#8221; said Doctor Rabbit
excitedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fine! Splendid!&#8221; shouted all
the little creatures of the Big Green
Woods. &#8220;Hurrah for Doctor Rabbit
and his scheme for getting rid of Ki-yi
Coyote!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; shouted Cheepy Chipmunk,
mounting a stump and speaking
so that all could hear, &#8220;I want you all
to come right down to my house for
dinner. Mother Chipmunk wants all of
you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine!&#8221; shouted Jimmy Chipmunk.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll get something good to eat, because
company&#8217;s coming!&#8221; His mother
frowned at him, but no one thought anything
about what Jimmy had said, they
were so delighted to get the invitation;
because Mother Chipmunk was about
the best cook in the whole woods.</p>





<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>Then away they all went toward
Cheepy Chipmunk&#8217;s house, talking and
laughing and shouting. And Billy Rabbit
and Jimmy Chipmunk and Johnny
Woodchuck kicked up their heels and
ran after each other all the way, they
were so happy.</p>

<p>It was a fine thing, they all said, to be
going to such a good dinner, and to know
that Ki-yi Coyote would not trouble
them any more. They declared that
they had never been so happy in all
their lives before.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
